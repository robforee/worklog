Dear Mr Sales,

I would like to present myself for the Desktop Support Tier 2 position at BlueBolt Technology Management.

I have extensive experience as a data engineer and am transitioning to a role which where I can contribute to shoring up defences at this time of increasing attacks. 

While your job post does not directly mention Cyber Security, it is clear to me that BlueBolt Technology Management significantly contributes to client security on many levels, and looking for "IT minded not necessarily IT knowledgeable" indicates that with my background, I could be of value to you and your clients and I welcome the opportunity to return to a customer service role.

To prepare for this transition, I receintly completed a boot camp which allowed me to get hands-on experience with a variety of security tools and explore network, application and endpoint vulnerabilities. We also spent time on the basics of networking, system administration, and risk analysis.

Adding this foundational knowledge to my deep experience with "script, scan, parse and analyze" means I will be able to understand and implement your protocols quickly and accurately, and be able to solve any problems through consultation and research.

Thank you for your consideration.
